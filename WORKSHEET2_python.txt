11. Lists: List is an ordered collections of items or values. It can be written as a list of comma separated values between 		square brackets[].Lists are mutable and can also contain duplicates in it.
    Tuple: Tuple are similar to a list but the only difference is mutability. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable i.e. they canâ€™t 	be modified.Values are stored in braces(). 
    Set: Sets are unoreder collection of elements. They can be written an comma seperated values in curly braces{}.Set is 	iterable and mutable. It does not allow duplicate values.
    Dictionary: It stores data in the form of key-value pairs. The keys defined for a dictionary need to be unique. Values 			in a dictionary can be mutable or immutable objects, only immutable objects are allowed for keys.
	It is defined using key-value pairs, separated by commas, enclosed within curly braces {Key: value}. The key and value 	are separated using a colon.
12. Strings are immutable in Python, which means you cannot change an existing string
	
	string ='I+Love+Python'
	str_new= string.replace('+',' ')
	print(str_new)
13. The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character
	Example: 
	ord('a')
	output: 97
    Example to find data type of a variable
	abc='Heloo'
	xyz=123
	print(type(abc))
	print(type(xyz))
    output:
	<class 'str'>
	<class 'int'>
